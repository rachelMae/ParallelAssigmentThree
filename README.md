1. Presents

One thing that could have led to more presents than “Thank you” notes is that when a servant started writing a thank you note for a present the present was in the lineup so another servant also started writing a thank you note, however, by the time the first finishes and removes the present the other servant will go and remove the present now in its place, however, no thank you note was written for that present. This could lead to multiple notes for one present and no notes for another present.

2. Weather

In order to simulate an hour of reading with 1 reading per minute, this program generates 60 readings and uses them accordingly. efficiency correctness, and progress guarantee.
